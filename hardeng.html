                <h2>Hardware Engineering</h2>
                <p>Computer hardware engineers design and supervise the manufacture and installation of computer systems and related products. They often spend considerable time solving problems, guiding installation, and conducting computer product testing. The following page provides an overview of the descriptions, salary information, and occupational projections for computer hardware engineering and related careers.</p>
                <h2>What Does a Computer Hardware Engineer Do?</h2>
                <p>Computer hardware engineers create the physical components that make computers run. They design new hardware systems, test their designs, analyze their test results, and manage manufacturing for completed projects. When new software changes users’ needs, these professionals redesign hardware to work with the new programs. Candidates typically need at least a bachelor’s degree to land hardware computer engineering jobs.</p>
                <p>Most hardware engineers work for computer companies and component manufacturers, while others work with research organizations and government employers. These professionals typically work full time with regular office hours. In this era of quick computer advancement, hardware engineers enjoy opportunities to work on exciting emerging technology. For example, some design artificial intelligence and virtual reality machines. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects the profession to grow by 6% from 2018-2028.</p>
                <p>This field is extremely competitive, so candidates must set themselves apart with excellent academic performance and certifications.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>How to Become a Computer Hardware Engineer?</h2>
                <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Earn Your Degree</h4>
                <p>Most employers in the computer hardware engineering field require entry-level applicants to hold bachelor’s degrees. Candidates may meet this requirement by obtaining a nominal degree in computer hardware engineering, but many employers also consider graduates with bachelor’s degrees in computer science and electrical engineering. Graduates with these degrees may earn certification to demonstrate their mastery of hardware engineering.</p>
                <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Gain Experience</h4>
                <p>While in school, learners can compile portfolios through projects and labs to help build their resumes. For example, circuits labs and classes help degree candidates hone their board engineering skills, and students who complete projects in their labs may outline their accomplishments, methods, and results in their portfolios. These pages may also include pictures and feedback from professors.</p>
                <p>Internships also allow learners to gain hands-on experience. Major technology corporations often offer internships to qualified candidates. Interns work side-by-side with experienced professionals to gain insight into their responsibilities and methods. Students may also participate in degree-related competitions, such as for robotics, to further build their portfolios. Certification courses can also round out resumes for entry-level candidates.</p>
                <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Earn Credentials</h4>
                <p>New computer hardware engineers can qualify for their first jobs with degrees and experience, but recent graduates often struggle to obtain professional experience. Those who failed to complete internships or need an extra boost can earn specialized credentials to add to their resumes. These professionals most benefit from certifications, which candidates can earn through professional organizations and universities.</p>
                <p>Graduates should choose their certifications based on their skill sets and positions of choice. For example, prospective cybersecurity professionals can earn the certified computer security incident handler credential. Learners use their degree knowledge in certification exams or in online courses to develop the skills for their desired career paths. Some manufacturers and tech companies, including Microsoft and Cisco, offer certifications in their products. Employers who work exclusively with technologies from these companies highly value such credentials.</p>
