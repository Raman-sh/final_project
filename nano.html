                <h2>Nano Technology</h2>
                <br>
                <h2>Career in Nano-Technology</h2>
                <p>As nanoscale science and engineering come to have an increasing impact on many aspects of our daily lives, the opportunities for careers are expanding rapidly. A major challenge is the education and training of a new generation of skilled workers.  Could you be one of them? Do you want a career in a new and exciting field which is predicted to impact every facet of our lives?
                    In areas as diverse as designing medical diagnostic devices to building better batteries, from creating cosmetics to enhancing energy efficient windows, from auto and plane manufacturing to researching the nature of matter itself, knowledge of nanoscale science and engineering will be increasingly important during upcoming years and decades.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>What Education is Needed and in which Fields?</h2>
                <p>Nanoscale phenomena underlie many of the properties and interactions of matter, and thus the sciences of physics, chemistry, and biology. However, nanoscale science is an interdisciplinary field – one where science and engineering intersect.  Studying science or engineering and paying attention to the developments in nanoscience that advance these fields can provide you with a solid foundation for any broad range of careers.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>What Type of Education is Needed for a Career in Nanotechnology?</h2>
                <p>Not everyone working in nanotechnology will require a doctorate degree in science or engineering.  A skilled workforce trained at a variety of levels is needed to meet the projected workforce challenge.  Education levels include:</p>
                <ul style="color: #999;">
                    <li>Technical program - high school degree plus additional certificate or vocational training</li>
                    <li>Associate degree - 2 years of college</li>
                    <li>Bachelors degree - 4 years of college</li>
                    <li>Masters degree - About 6 years of college total</li>
                    <li>Doctorate - About 9 years of college total</li>
                </ul>
                <br><h2>Salary</h2>
                <p>In US, the salary of nanotechnology engineering technicians ranges from $30,000 to $94,000.
                    The starting remuneration in this field depends upon the industry. A fresher will gets the annual salary of around 3 lacs. Salary varies in the public and private sector.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Jobs and Career Scope</h2>
                    <p>Plenty of career options available for nanotechnology professionals. Opportunities exist in medical, healthcare industry research, environment industries, pharmaceutical, agriculture, product development and advising, communication, and media.
                        The nanotechnology field is appropriate for scientists, engineers, and technicians.</p>
                        <p>In the field of engineering, nanotechnology is used by engineers to develop computer components and microscopic sensors.
                            As we know nanotechnology is used everywhere, so, the need of nanotechnology is demanding and changes it faces at every step.</p>
                            <p>Aspirants can create their career in this field with better remuneration. The research studies in this field are the very good choice for those wish to pursue higher studies. The use of Nanotechnology is wide and vast such as in food science, in medical, in engineering, and many others.</p>
