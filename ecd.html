                <h2>Electronic Circuit Design Engineer</h2>
                <br>
                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>These professionals are in charge of creating circuit layouts of new products, microcircuits, microprocessors, etc. Circuit design engineers test and debug circuit designs. They analyze the existing systems to troubleshoot defects and improve the design. Their job is to design and incorporate analog and digital circuits. As a circuit design engineer, you define and implement electronic plans. You also interconnect the electrical framework. You are responsible for the entire circuit design process.</p>
                <p>The minimum educational requirement is a bachelor's degree in electrical or electronics engineering or any related field. You must have previous experience in a related area. You must be familiar with testing procedures and equipment and knowledge of simulation software. Employers expect applicants to be proficient with a computer and the MS Office. Your job requires you to have analytical, problem-solving, andÂ communication skills. The circuit design engineer earns $88,475 on average annually.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>How To Become a Circuit Design Engineer?</h2>
                <p>If you're interested in becoming a circuit design engineer, one of the first things to consider is how much education you need. We've determined that 63.5% of circuit design engineers have a bachelor's degree. In terms of higher education levels, we found that 16.3% of circuit design engineers have master's degrees. Even though most circuit design engineers have a college degree, it's possible to become one with only a high school degree or GED.
                    Choosing the right major is always an important step when researching how to become a circuit design engineer. When we researched the most common majors for a circuit design engineer, we found that they most commonly earn bachelor's degree degrees or master's degree degrees. Other degrees that we often see on circuit design engineer resumes include associate degree degrees or high school diploma degrees.</p>
                    <p>You may find that experience in other jobs will help you become a circuit design engineer. In fact, many circuit design engineer jobs require experience in a role such as design engineer. Meanwhile, many circuit design engineers also have previous career experience in roles such as engineer or research assistant.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Job Outlook and Salary information</h2>
                    <p>In May 2019, the BLS reported that professionals in the 90th percentile or higher earned $164,210 or more per year, whereas the bottom 10th percentile earned $66,620 or less per year. The BLS also stated that electronics engineers were expected to see a one percent increase in employment from 2019-2029.
                        Circuit designers need to hold a bachelor's degree in an engineering field, and some jobs or employers may require a master's degree. These professionals also need to be proficient in design software and usually require work experience. The median annual salary for all electronics engineers is about $105,570.</p>
