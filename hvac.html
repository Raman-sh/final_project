                <h2>HVAC Engineering</h2>
                <p>HVAC engineers provide engineering services specialized in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. They design and test devices related to these functions to adapt them to the space they need to operate in.
                    They are expected to adapt devices to their customers' needs when designing and installing HVAC systems. They manage their work within given deadlines and budget restrictions, fitting in maintenance work or reparations if necessary.
                    A bachelor's degree in engineering is usually required of candidates for this position. Experience in working with HVAC systems also boosts the chances of getting hired; potential candidates can gain some practical know-how by completing an internship before diving into this position.</p>

                    <h2>What Does a Hvac Engineer Do?</h2>
                    <p>There are certain skills that many hvac engineers have in order to accomplish their responsibilities. By taking a look through resumes, we were able to narrow down the most common skills for a person in this position. We discovered that a lot of resumes listed creativity, listening skills and problem-solving skills.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>How To Become a Hvac Engineer</h2>
                    <p>If you're interested in becoming a hvac engineer, one of the first things to consider is how much education you need. We've determined that 61.7% of hvac engineers have a bachelor's degree. In terms of higher education levels, we found that 8.9% of hvac engineers have master's degrees. Even though most hvac engineers have a college degree, it's possible to become one with only a high school degree or GED.</p>
                    <p>Choosing the right major is always an important step when researching how to become a hvac engineer. When we researched the most common majors for a hvac engineer, we found that they most commonly earn bachelor's degree degrees or associate degree degrees. Other degrees that we often see on hvac engineer resumes include master's degree degrees or diploma degrees.</p>
                    <p>You may find that experience in other jobs will help you become a hvac engineer. In fact, many hvac engineer jobs require experience in a role such as hvac technician. Meanwhile, many hvac engineers also have previous career experience in roles such as mechanical engineer or service technician.</p>

                    <h2>How Much Do HVAC Engineers Make?</h2>
                    <p>HVAC engineers earn a range of salaries, depending on their experience, their education, their location, and their additional skills. ZipRecruiter (2021) showed an average annual salary of $82,752. Those in the 25th percentile made $58,000 or less, while those in the 75th percentile made $92,500 or more. A few employees reported receiving bonuses and profit-sharing amounts.

                        Notably, individuals with project management skills earned 9 percent more than other engineers. Those who reported AutoCAD MEP as their main skill earned 7 percent less than other engineers.</p>
                        <p>Another source of data had different figures. PayScale (2021) reported an average annual salary of $68,456 among its HVAC engineers. It also found a median salary of $68,000. That means half of the wages are less than $68,000 and half are greater than $68,000.

                            The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS May 2019) combines HVAC engineers with all mechanical engineers and reported a median of $88,430 salary for all mechanical engineers. BLS statistics are compiled from surveys of industries.</p>

                            <h2>What are the requirements to become an HVAC Engineer?</h2>
                            <p>HVAC engineers typically need at least a bachelor’s degree. They may obtain their degree in mechanical engineering or HVAC engineering technology. For those seeking the highest quality education who wish to someday become licensed Professional Engineers (PE), it’s important to attend an institution that is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).</p>
                            <p>Successful HVAC engineers have personal characteristics in common to engineers in other subfields. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS 2021) lists the following skills as important:</p>
                            <ul style="color: #999;">
