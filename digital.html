                <h2>Electronics Engineer</h2>
                <br>
                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>With the emerging rise in the electronics industry, new leading firms are springing up to meet the needs of the consumer market. The profile of electronics engineer has a great demand in the market and this has created a lot of opportunities for the ECE aspirants.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>What Does an Electronics Engineer Do?</h2>
                <p>An electronics engineer is concerned with the components and circuitry that comprise electronic equipment and making sure that equipment functions properly. A subset of electrical engineering, electronics engineering works with internal systems that are designed to interpret specific signals and respond by performing a task detailed by predetermined parameters. These engineers design and oversee the manufacture of many types of electronic equipment, including televisions, cell phones, GPS devices, satellites, broadcast and communication networks, and radar and sonar systems.</p>
                <p>Electronics engineers evaluate customer needs and establish the guidelines, processes and budgets for the creation of electronic systems. They generate procedures for maintenance and quality testing, ensuring products meet industry regulations and safety standards. To optimize performance, these engineers assess and suggest modifications for the electronic components used in various systems and pieces of equipment.</p>
                <p>To excel in this field, an electronics engineer must be proficient in mathematics and science, feel passionate about technology, and enjoy creative analysis and problem-solving. This field is challenging and demands a considerable amount of time, energy and focus. It requires a number of technical skills, including analysis of electrical components, electronic system troubleshooting and equipment repair, and software development and implementation. Electronics engineers should also show an aptitude for leadership and teamwork and be prepared for long hours of hard work.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>What Types of Industries Do Electronic Engineers Work In?</h2>
                <p>The worldwide demand for electronics engineers has remained high for years, largely due to the rapid growth of technology. Because such advancements exist across a wide variety of industries and show no signs of slowing down, electronics engineers are highly sought after. Common industries that employ electronics engineers include information technology, telecommunications, manufacturing, conservation, medical technology, military, robotics, aviation and aeronautics.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Top Jobs in Electronic Engineering</h2>
                <p>These professionals earn significantly more than the national average, and this trend is projected to continue into the future. Entry-level electronics engineers earn an average yearly salary of $76,840, increasing to $95,000 - $108,000 after ten years or more of experience. There is plenty of room for advancement in this field, especially if you continue your education into graduate school and pursue additional professional licensing. After 20 years of experience, many electronics engineers are promoted to management positions, which equates to even higher wages.</p>
                <p>A degree in electronics engineering can provide you with a number of exciting career opportunities, including positions like computer hardware engineer, artificial intelligence engineer, electrical circuit engineer, control systems engineer, robotics and automation engineer, industrial applications engineer, communication and remote-sensing engineer, aerospace and electrical systems engineer, and instrumentation and measurement engineer.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>How Much Education Does Electronic Engineering Require?</h2>
                <p>Electronics engineering positions require a bachelor’s degree in electronics engineering, electrical engineering or a related engineering field. Online degree programs in electronics engineering have become increasingly prominent, especially with the advent of COVID-19 closing many colleges for the foreseeable future. Students with bachelor’s degrees from online programs share the same job prospects and career success as students with degrees from in-person educational programs. They may end up more successful, in fact, as online degree programs allow you to coordinate studying around part-time or full-time jobs, increasing cost-effectiveness.</p>
                <p>To be eligible for a supervisory role, it is usually necessary to obtain a Professional Engineer (PE) license. Each state has its own regulations, but the typical prerequisites are an engineering degree from an ABET-accredited institution, passing scores on both the Fundamental of Engineering (FE) exam and the Professional Engineering (PE) exam, and four years of relevant work experience.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Salary</h2>
                <p>The median annual wage for electronics engineers, except computer was $107,540 in May 2020. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $69,210, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $167,410.</p>
