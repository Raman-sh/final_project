                <h2>What is Nuclear Engineering??</h2>
                <p>Nuclear engineering, a field of engineering that deals with the science and application of nuclear and radiological processes. These processes include the release, control and use of nuclear energy as well as the production and use of radiation and radioactive material for applications in research, industry, medicine and national security. Nuclear engineering is based on the fundamentals of physics and mathematics that describe nuclear interactions and the transport of neutrons and gamma rays. These phenomena in turn depend on heat transfer, fluid flow, chemical reactions and the behavior of materials when subjected to radiation. Nuclear engineering is therefore by nature a multifaceted discipline, drawing on several branches of physics, and, like the aerospace industry, it relies to a large extent on modeling and simulation for the design and analysis of complex systems that are too large and expensive to be tested.</p>
              <br>
              
           <h2>What do Nuclear Engineers do?</h2>
           <p>
            -Design or develop nuclear equipment, such as reactor cores, radiation shielding, and associated instrumentation<br><br>
-Direct operating or maintenance activities of operational nuclear power plants to ensure that they meet safety standards<br><br>
-Write operational instructions to be used in nuclear plant operation or in handling and disposing of nuclear waste<br><br>
-Monitor nuclear facility operations to identify any design, construction, or operation practices that violate safety regulations and laws<br><br>
-Perform experiments to test whether methods of using nuclear material, reclaiming nuclear fuel, or disposing of nuclear waste are acceptable<br><br>
-Take corrective actions or order plant shutdowns in emergencies<br><br>
-Examine nuclear accidents and gather data that can be used to design preventive measures<br><br>
-In addition, nuclear engineers are at the forefront of developing uses of nuclear material for medical imaging devices, such as positron emission tomography (PET) scanners. They also may develop or design cyclotrons, which produce a high-energy beam that the healthcare industry uses to treat cancerous tumors.

                   <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);"><li>Education Required</li></h3>
               <p>Entry-level nuclear engineering jobs in private industry require a bachelors degree. Some entry-level nuclear engineering jobs may require at least a masters degree or even a Ph.D.</p>

               <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);"><li>Training Required</li></h3>
               <p>A newly hired nuclear engineer at a nuclear power plant usually must complete training onsite, in such areas as safety procedures, practices, and regulations, before being allowed to work independently. Training lasts from 6 weeks to 3 months, depending on the employer. In addition, these engineers must undergo continuous training every year to keep their knowledge, skills, and abilities current with laws, regulations, and safety procedures.</p>
