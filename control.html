                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Control systems engineers are responsible for designing, developing, and managing dynamic control systems in large organizations. They basically ensure that the processes run safely and efficiently. They conduct researches and oversee the installation of ICT equipment. They also define the control algorithms and select tools, earning a median sum of $85,000 annually or $40 per hour. Control systems engineers bring stability to the control dynamic systems to produce the desired outcome.</p>
                <p>They determine how to control the system's variables and the production line using mathematical modeling. They also develop software and design the systems based on the company's requirements. Part of their duties may include creating prototypes and testing the created prototypes. They then implement the system and conduct routine maintenance checks.</p>
                <p>Control systems engineers mostly hold a bachelor's or master's degree in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, or other related fields. They are expected to have strong mathematical abilities and excellent problem-solving, communication, and software development skills. Some employers prefer candidates with some years of proven experience in a related role.</p>
                <br>
