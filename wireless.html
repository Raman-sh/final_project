                <h2>Wireless Communications Engineer</h2>
                <br>
                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Wireless technology is a relatively new and rapidly changing area of communications. Currently, wireless communication jobs are found with cable television providers, cell phone companies, internet providers, and retail outlets that sell wireless devices and services.</p>
                <p>Careers in wireless communications range from customer service to product development. You have the option of working directly with customers as a sales associate or customer service agent, demonstrating products and answering questions from customers to help them decide what to buy. You may choose to work in the technical side of the industry, installing wireless systems, troubleshooting problems, and maintaining equipment. You also have the option of working in a professional position as an engineer where you may design new products or create new technologies.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>What Type of Education Do These Careers Require?</h2>
                <p>The education required is based on the type of job you want. For sales or customer service positions, there may be no education requirement. Repair, maintenance, and installation technicians may need technical training and engineers may need an advanced degree.
                    Some schools offer programs in wireless communications which could be beneficial no matter what job you are pursuing. A wireless communications certificate, associate, or graduate certificate program offers training in wireless technology, networks, security, troubleshooting, and systems.
                    Customer service or sales positions may require a certificate or associate degree in customer service. These programs may offer courses on computer applications, human relations, problem management, and teamwork.
                    Repair, maintenance, and installation careers may require a certificate or degree in electronics or telecommunications. Many employers provide on-the-job training for technicians and require no formal training, but earning a technical certificate or degree may be helping in a competitive job market.
                    A wireless communications engineer usually needs at least a bachelor's degree in engineering. You may also wish to pursue a master's degree in wireless communications or a post-bachelor's certificate in wireless engineering.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>How Much Can I Earn In These Careers?</h2>
                <p>Due to the variety of career choices, salary ranges are rather broad. It is helpful to look at the individual career options to get a better idea of earning potential.
                    The mean salary of sales representatives in the software industry, according to PayScale.com, was $53,261 in 2019; however, sales commissions could increase this figure significantly.
                    The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported an annual mean wage for wireless telecommunications equipment installers and repairers of $57,080 in May of 2018 (www.bls.gov).
                    Wireless communications engineers in the 25th-75th percentiles earned roughly $58,000 to $132,000 as of November 2019, according to PayScale.com.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Aims and Scope</h2>
                    <p>The wireless communication revolution has brought fundamental changes to data networking, telecommunication, and has made integrated networks a reality. Wireless Networks focuses on the networking and user aspects of this field. It provides a single common and global forum for archival value contributions documenting these fast growing areas of interest. The journal publishes refereed articles dealing with research, experience and management issues of wireless networks. It allows readers to benefit from experience, problems and solutions described. Regularly addressed issues include: network architectures for personal communication systems, wireless LANS, radio, tactical and other wireless networks, design and analysis of protocols, network management and network performance, network services and service integration, nomadic computing, internets working with cable and other wireless networks, standardization and regulatory issues, specific system descriptions, applications and user interface, and enabling technologies for wireless networks.</p>
