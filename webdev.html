                <h2>Web Development</h2>
                <br>
                <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
                <p>It is the process of building websites and applications for the internet, or for a private network known as an intranet. Web development is not concerned with the design of a website; rather, it’s all about the coding and programming that powers the website’s functionality.
                    From the most simple, static web pages to social media platforms and apps, from e-commerce websites to content management systems (CMS); all the tools we use via the internet on a daily basis have been built by web developers.
                    Web development can be broken down into three layers: client-side coding (frontend), server-side coding (backend) and database technology.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Why Pursue a Career in Web Development?</h2>
                    <p>Web developers typically work indoors in an office environment. Web development careers allow for independent work, as well as collaborative work as part of a team. Professionals can also decide if they want to work for a small company or a large tech firm.

                        Web developers need a thorough understanding of computers and coding languages. These professionals also need to be detail oriented and have excellent communication skills to work effectively with their clients. Many web developers also exhibit a keen eye for design.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Web Developer Career Roadmap</h2>
                        <p>Most of the time, people get confused about where to start and what are the skills they need to master for their preferred job role. So, here is a road map that will provide you the path you need to follow in order to start your  developer:</p>
                        <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Bachelor’s Degree</h4>
                        <p>The first step is to get a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. Once you have completed your graduation, you can master the important skills required to become a front end developer.</p>
                        <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Technical Skills</h4>
                        <h5 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Front End Skills</h5>
                        <p>HTML – HyperText Markup Language(HTML) is the foundation of all websites. It’s the main file type that is loaded in your browser when you look at a website.</p>
                        <p>CSS – Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) is used for styling the HTML elements. It provides 1000s of styling functions that are used to style the HTML elements.</p>
                        <p>JavaScript – This programming language allows you to interact with elements on the website and to manipulate them. While CSS adds style to HTML, JavaScript adds interactivity and makes a website more dynamic.</p>
                        <p>Responsive Design –  One major role of a front end developer is to understand the responsive design principles and how to implement them on the coding side. It is an intrinsic part of CSS frameworks like the Bootstrap.</p>
                        <p>Build Tools – The modern web browsers come equipped with developer tools for testing and debugging. These tools allow you to test the web pages in the browser itself and finds out how the page is interpreting the code. Browser developer tools usually consist of an inspector and a JavaScript console.</p>
                        <p>Version Control/ Git – Version control is the process of tracking and controlling changes to your source code so that you don’t have to start from the beginning if anything goes wrong.</p>
                        <p>CSS and JavaScript frameworks are collections of CSS or JS files that perform different tasks by providing common functionality. Some of the popular frameworks are jQuery, Angular, React, Vue.</p>
                        <h5 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Back End Skills</h5>
                        <p>Python is an open-source, object-oriented programming language that was released in 1991 and ever since it has become one of the favorite languages of most software and web developers</p>
                        <p>Java is an open-source, high-level programming language that was released by Sun Microsystems in 1996. It follows the Write Once Run Anywhere (WORA) approach that makes it compatible to run on any platform.</p>
                        <p>PHP is an open-source, server-side scripting language used to develop the back-end logic of an application. It is a powerful tool for making dynamic and interactive websites.</p>
                        <p>Node JS is an open-source, JavaScript framework used specifically for creating the back end or the server-side of an application. Through NodeJS, JavaScript can now finally run on the server-side of the web.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Non Technical Skills</h4>
                        <p>We have a misconception that the developers are only required to create user interfaces effectively. But to make efficient products, it is also important to communicate with the clients and grasp ideas. You should be well-versed with verbal and vocal communication skills. Also, to work with a team, you need to possess the basic lessons of the team working too.</p>
                        <p>One thing that all developers must have, regardless of the job description or official title, it’s excellent problem-solving skills. From figuring out how to best implement a design to fixing bugs that crop up, to figuring out how to make your code work with the backend code being implemented, development is all about creative problem-solving.</p>
                        <p>These are the important skills required to build your web developer career.</p>
