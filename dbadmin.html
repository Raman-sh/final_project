                <h2>Database Administrator</h2>
                <br>
                <h2>What does a data administrator do?</h2>
                <p>Database administrators maintain and protect sensitive information and provide access to important datasets for companies, institutions, and government bodies. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that database administration jobs will grow by 9% from 2018-2028. These professionals organize sensitive datasets such as financial records, purchase histories, and customer details, and they make materials available to other professionals while maintaining information security and privacy settings.</p>
                <p>Database administrators also back up, restore, and troubleshoot database sets and system access, updating and integrating old programs to implement the latest technology.</p>
                <p>Database administrators need at least a bachelor’s degree in information science or computer science for most entry-level positions. Depending on the size and complexity of their company or governing body, these professionals may need a master’s degree in database administration or information technology. All database administrators need fundamental knowledge of structured query language (SQL) and software vendor certifications.</p>
                <h2>Key hard skills</h2>
                <p>Like many scientific and technical professionals, database administrators need to master several hard skills to obtain and perform their jobs. The hard skills listed below require time, concentration, and technological aptitude to acquire. Keep in mind that the specific hard skills for database administration typically vary by company, position, and project.</p>
                <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">SQL</h4>
                <p>SQL, a computer language, orients and organizes all data management systems. Students should understand the three dominant database languages: Microsoft SQL, Oracle Database, and IBM’s DB2. Professionals may need to build websites with MySQL, create relational connections among multiple datasets with Transact-SQL, and control object-oriented concepts with PL/SQL.</p>
                <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Unix</h4>
                <p>This portable, multi-user, multitasking operating system interface is made available by The Open Group. Written in C programming language, UNIX provides the organizational foundation for most Mac, Android, Chrome, and PlayStation systems. Therefore, it represents a critical building block for database management and administration.</p>
                <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Linux</h4>
                <p>Modeled after UNIX, the open-source operating system Linux operates with versatility to control a variety of computer systems, including smartphones and supercomputers. Linux is free to install, and users can access online coding and troubleshooting hacks to create comprehensive platforms for clients and companies.</p>
                <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Oracle</h4>
                <p>A relational database framework oriented through SQL, Oracle provides access to and organizes datasets. It also integrates information into user-friendly platforms for companies and institutions. Similar to SQL, Oracle works with most major platforms, including Windows, UNIX, Linux, and Mac OS.</p>
                <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Windows OS</h4>
                <p>Windows OS represents the orienting graphic interface for all Microsoft products. The core operating system for Microsoft desktops and programs, Windows differs from Linux and UNIX systems in that it is corporately owned and not openly accessible. Currently, Windows OS is the dominant system worldwide.</p>
                <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Data Analysis</h4>
                <p>By inspecting, collating, and interpreting datasets, data analysts translate massive bodies of information into useful and illustrative material for companies and clients. Analysts also use analytical interpretation to streamline systems by cleaning datasets, which involves prioritizing and itemizing metadata, and by providing insights on system improvements.</p>
                <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Microsoft Access</h4>
                <p>This is the key information management tool behind referencing, reporting, and data analysis in data administration. MS Access translates metadata sets, particularly from Microsoft Excel sheets, into usable, searchable datasets. Database administrators use this tool to prioritize relationships among datasets and coalesce materials.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Key soft skills</h2>
                <p>Database administrators must also possess some general, less-quantifiable strengths, and skills, often referred to as “soft skills.” Communication, organization, and problem-solving prove useful in almost any position. Companies making data-driven decisions particularly appreciate candidates with analytics and business acumen.</p>
                <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Analytics</h4>
                <p>The ability to systematically analyze data or statistics helps database administrators identify and meet their companies’ data management needs. Database administrators often conduct updated analyses of their databases, as well.</p>
                <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Communication</h4>
                <p>Database administrators often supervise other IT staff, and good communication skills prove valuable to IT teamwork and leadership. Database administrators also communicate with executive management, suppliers, and technology professionals at other organizations.</p>
                <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Problem solving</h4>
                <p>The capacity to identify, test, and eliminate potential problems and their causes is extremely valuable to database administrators, who spend a considerable amount of time troubleshooting. Creativity also comes into play, as database administrators often need to generate new solutions to new problems.</p>
                <h4 style="color: rgb(119, 116, 116);">Organization</h4>
                <p>Databases require considerable organization, and database administrators organize data to make database decisions and create reports. They also organize IT department tasks and employees.</p>
