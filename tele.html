                <h2>Telecommunication Engineer</h2>
                <br>
                <h2>Job description</h2>
                <p>Telecommunications engineers perform a variety of duties, but their main focus involves the installation and repair of telecommunication lines and equipment. Other duties include designing new methods of using electrical power to develop products, developing manufacturing methodologies, ensuring construction and installation specifications and standards, testing electrical equipment to specifications, evaluating problems, and selling equipment and services. Telecommunications engineers in the government sector generally work on federal electronic systems and devices, such as satellites and secure communication systems.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>How to Become a Telecommunications Engineer?</h2>
                <p>Individuals who are interested in becoming telecommunications engineers should first understand the necessary educational and experience requirements. To enter the field of telecommunications engineering, specific, detailed technical training and education are required, including a bachelor’s degree.</p>
                <p>Students who are studying to become telecommunications engineers take specialized courses as well as gain laboratory and field experience. Those interested in earning a higher salary and expanding their career options can consider furthering their education. A master’s degree in electrical engineering can help open up leadership and specialized professional opportunities.</p>
                <p>After earning a degree in the field, students should consider pursuing licenses and certification. While these are not always required for entry-level jobs, they are often required by certain employers and can help with advancement in the field.</p>
                <p>Licensure consists of passing the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam as well as the Professional Engineering Exam. Certifications can include: Building Industry Consulting Service (BICSI), Avaya, Microsoft’s MCSE, Cisco’s CCNP or CCIE, and Juniper Networks’ JNCIE or JNCIP.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Salary and Benefits</h2>
                <p>Telecommunications engineers earn a competitive compensation and receive substantial benefits.</p>
                <ul style="color: #999;">
                    <li>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in May 2019 the annual median salary for telecommunications engineers across the U.S. was $98,600.</li>
                    <li>This salary can vary based on experience, organization, education, and geographic location. For example, the BLS describes how the top 10% of electronics engineers, which includes telecommunications engineers, can make more than $164,210.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Most full-time telecom engineers receive full benefits, depending on their experience, skill level, and place of employment. Roughly 20% of telecom engineers are union members who are covered by union contracts. Many belong to groups such as the Communications Workers of America or the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Required Skills for Telecommunications Engineers</h2>
                <p>Since telecommunications engineering involves complex technical tasks and job responsibilities, it is important for individuals to exhibit a certain set of skills in the workplace. Some of these required skills include the following.</p>
                <ul style="color: #999;">
                    <li>Mathematical Skills - Mathematical ability is crucial for telecom engineers. Advanced math such as calculus enables telecom engineers to analyze situations, solve problems, and troubleshoot and design equipment.</li>
                    <li>Focus and Concentration - Focus and concentration are also essential skills for telecommunications engineers. Developing complex electrical systems means keeping track of multiple technical components and design elements while performing intricate tasks.</li>
                    <li>Initiative - As technology, computer and communication systems advance, engineers must not only keep pace with these changes but proactively anticipate and lead them.</li>
                    <li>Organizational Skills - In their work, telecom engineers carefully collect, organize, and document the complex information to install telecom infrastructures and software. Keeping accurate, clear records also helps with hardware and software maintenance, upgrades, and troubleshooting.</li>
                    <li>Communication and Interpersonal Skills - Communication and interpersonal skills are key for telecom engineers who interact with technicians, customers, and co-workers. Being able to clearly communicate complex issues in plain language is necessary for engineers, especially when dealing with stakeholders who have little or no technical experience.</li>
                    <li>Cross-platform System Skill - Having skills on platforms that can operate on more than one computer architecture or operating system can help engineers find work more readily and excel in their profession.</li>
                    <li>Mechanical Skills - Engineers who have mechanical skills, and a familiarity with multiple devices and types of equipment, often have an upper hand in finding and landing more job opportunities.</li>
                </ul>
