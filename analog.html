                <h2>Analog Design Engineer</h2>
                <br>
                <h2>About Analog Design Engineer</h2>
                <p>Analog design engineers are responsible for designing electrical signals across a range of electronic equipment. As an analog design engineer, you should have the basics of analog and digital fundamentals as you would be providing solutions to significant problems related to your field. You will provide a specific design solution, which will be further designed on computer-aided design software to test functionality, planning, placement and routing, speed, latency, and debugging appropriately. The design will be fabricated; hence, you must guarantee its functionality, maintenance, and updating.</p>
                <p>You should be creative, initiative, have interpersonal skills, communication skills, and perseverance. You should also be self-motivated and have a sound knowledge of circuit design, integrated circuits, and all software regarding the field. You need a bachelor's degree in electrical and electronics engineering, electronics and communication engineering, or other related engineering courses. You will earn an average of $102,249 per year.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Roles and responsibilities</h2>
                <p>The analog electronic engineer designs integrated circuits, electronic boards or equipment (antennas, sensors …) dealing with analog signals.</p>
                 <p>On a daily basis, he/she takes part in the following tasks:</p>
                    <ul style="color: #999;">
                    <li> Analysis of the existing electronics</li>
                    
                    <li>Design, follow-up of realization and tests of partial models to validate electronic units and sub-units</li>
                    
                    <li>Technical discussions, sometimes in English, with the various interlocutors of the projects</li>
                    
                    <li>Animation of design and qualification reviews throughout development</li>
                    
                    <li>Design, follow-up and validation of the equipment required for acceptance and qualification tests</li>
                    
                    <li>Validation of performances and participation in the qualification</li>
                    
                    <li>Documentation of the project</li></ul>

                    <h2>How To Become an Analog Design Engineer?</h2>
                    <p>If you're interested in becoming an analog design engineer, one of the first things to consider is how much education you need. We've determined that 63.6% of analog design engineers have a bachelor's degree. In terms of higher education levels, we found that 27.3% of analog design engineers have master's degrees. Even though most analog design engineers have a college degree, it's impossible to become one with only a high school degree or GED.
                        Choosing the right major is always an important step when researching how to become an analog design engineer. When we researched the most common majors for an analog design engineer, we found that they most commonly earn bachelor's degree degrees or master's degree degrees. Other degrees that we often see on analog design engineer resumes include associate degree degrees or doctoral degree degrees.</p>
                    <p>You may find that experience in other jobs will help you become an analog design engineer. In fact, many analog design engineer jobs require experience in a role such as design engineer. Meanwhile, many analog design engineers also have previous career experience in roles such as research assistant or radio frequency engineer.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Salary</h2>
                    <p>At the start of a career in France, depending on his/her education and the region where he/she works, he/she can claim a salary between € 33K and € 36K.
                        Then, the salary will vary depending on the level of experience, the types of projects, the level of involvement, the type of company, the region where it is located… many elements are to be taken into account.</p>
