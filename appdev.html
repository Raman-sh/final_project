                <h2>App Development</h2>
                <br>
                <h2>What is an App developer?</h2>
                <p>When it comes to technology, there are plenty of career paths one can take. One area that has seen an
                    incredible rise in popularity is that of app development. There are literally millions of apps
                    available today, from music apps to banking apps. that help people perform specific tasks.</p>
                <p>An app developer is a computer software engineer whose primary responsibilities include creating,
                    testing and programming apps for computers, mobile phones, and tablets. These developers typically
                    work in teams, and think of ideas and concepts either for the general public, or for a specific
                    customer need.</p>
                <p>App developers understand coding languages and how to use them, and may also work alongside graphic
                    artists, data scientists, and other software experts to create applications. They also test and fix
                    any bugs that are found before the product is launched.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>What does an App developer do?</h2>
                <p>Applications software can be written for a particular operating system (OS), such as Android, iOS or
                    Windows. App developers typically specialize in a specific development area, such as mobile phone
                    applications, graphics software, accounting software, or office suites.</p>
                <p>Marketing firms often conduct research in order to gather information relating to consumer needs.
                    This information is then passed on to app developers who create new applications that meet the
                    public's needs in terms of use and cost. Several versions are made of the same basic application
                    that can be read by different types of devices, such as cell phones, tablets and personal computers.
                </p>
                <p>Once an app is complete and goes into production, the app developer works on creating patches
                    (upgrades), that are periodically released to the public. App developers work for themselves just as
                    often as they work for small, medium and large sized companies, building ‘native’ experiences that
                    allow people to complete tasks, consume content and interact with brands and other people.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Job skills and requirements for an App developer?</h2>
                <p>Analytical Skills - recognizing the needs of customers, and creating new applications that answer
                    those needs</p>
                <p>Communication - clearly communicating ideas to coders, teammates and management</p>
                <p>Creativity - inventing new ways of handling problems and developing innovative applications</p>
                <p>Customer Service - If dealing directly with clients and customers, having excellent customer service
                    skills to answer questions and fix issues</p>
                <p>Attention to Detail - having all parts of applications working together for the application to
                    function</p>
                <p>Problem-Solving - making decisions that move the project forward</p>
                <p>Teamwork - As part of a large team of developers, working well with others</p>
                <p>Technical Skills - being adept in computer languages and having good technical knowledge</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Types of App developers</h2>
                <h4 style="color: #999;">Mobile App Developers</h4>
                <p>Smartphones and, more recently, tablets are increasingly becoming the computer of choice for more and
                    more people. Mobile app developers have specialized training in design for small electronic
                    equipment, and write computer programs for smartphones and other mobile devices.</p>
                <p>Instead of building for a larger PC screen, these developers are dealing with extremely small
                    Android, iPhone, or BlackBerry screens. They are experienced in multi-media applications and
                    multiple mobile computer programming languages.</p>
                <p>Mobile app developers typically write programs using either objective C, C++, Python, or Java. Each
                    mobile device uses a specific programming language which app developers must understand.</p>
                <h4 style="color: #999;">Android Developers</h4>
                <p>Android is the name of the mobile operating system owned by Google. Android typically comes installed
                    on a variety of smartphones and tablets from many manufacturers such as Samsung, Sony, and Motorola
                    (as well as on Google's own Nexus smartphone), giving users access to Google services such as
                    Search, YouTube, Maps, Gmail, etc.</p>
                <p>An android developer develops applications for use on phones and tablets that utilize the android
                    operating system - everything from interactive games to media players, to electronic book readers
                    and global navigation software. The code required for android development is mostly open source and
                    available freely for anyone interested in developing apps for use with the Android OS.</p>
                <p>It’s an exciting time to have a career in Android development. There is a healthy supply of jobs,
                    demand for Android apps is accelerating, and technology is advancing.</p>
                <h4 style="color: #999;">iOS Developer</h4>
                <p>iOS is a shortened way of saying ‘iPhone OS’, or ‘iPhone Operating System’, and is the mobile
                    operating system that runs on Apple’s mobile devices such as iPhones and iPads.</p>
                <p>iOS developers build software – they know how to structure it, test it, debug it, and how to use
                    source control. iOS developers know Swift or Objective-C (and some know both languages, which is
                    best).</p>
                <p>They know iOS, which means they have a good grasp on build views; can handle user interaction; can
                    display data; show alerts; handle navigation; display images, labels and text views; and integrate
                    with REST APIs and parse JSON.</p>
